# Project 0
This project consists of four HTML pages:  a homepage and three linked pages about things I like. The first page is a homepage with a table linking to the other pages and some descriptive text. This page is styled using the stylesheet style.css. The second page has a picture of a Havanese, which is the breed of dog that I have. This contains a footer element linking to the other pages. It also contains a mobile-responsive @media query that shrinks the size of the footer text when you shorten the width of the page. This page is also styled with style.css. The third page talks about styles of music that I like. This uses Bootstrap elements such as the grid model and the alert styling as well as some custom internal CSS styling. This also has a footer element linking to the other pages. The final HTML page describes my martial arts experience and some books and movies that I like with unordered lists and a table. This is styled using a Sass stylesheet that uses examples of inheritance, nesting, and variables.
