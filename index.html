        <p id=para2> This webpage shows you some of my favorite things in life. I have a dog named Coco, and she is a Havanese.
            I also used to play piano and love music. The link above tells you my favorite genres of music. Finally, I 
            have trained in different martial arts styles since I was young. The link above lists some of the styles I've trained
            and some other cool martial arts books and movies.
